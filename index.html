        <p>
          A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired
          by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
          yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their
          historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled
          and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet,
          in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered,
          flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
